## 👋 Hi, I’m @christophercrow

- 👀 I’m interested in **data-intensive astrophysics**, **cybersecurity**, and **high-performance computing** (HPC).  
  I love exploring how cutting-edge technology (Docker, Spark, HPC clusters) can bring massive data sets to life—whether in the realm of astrophysics research or homelab security experiments.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - **Advanced HPC workflows** for large-scale Monte Carlo simulations  
  - **Cybersecurity incident response** and SIEM tuning (Splunk, Security Onion)  
  - **ETL pipeline optimization** with Python, Bash, and AWS services  

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
  - **Open-source data science** or astrophysics projects  
  - **Systems architecture** and **secure network design** for research or production environments  

- 📫 How to reach me:
  - **Email:** [cecrow@unc.edu](mailto:cecrow@unc.edu)  
  - **LinkedIn:** [https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-crow-915288240/]
